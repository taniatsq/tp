## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [p/PHONE_NUMBER]` can be used as `n/John Doe p/85018888` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

**Additional tips for Attendance taking** <br>
- For quick attendance taking, here are the 3-4 steps that you can take:
  1. Use the `adda` command to mark everyone as present.
  2. Find the indexes of students who are absent and those who have valid reasons.
  3. Use the `edita` command to mark them as absent/having a valid reason at one shot.
- Moreover, to facilitate easier reading of a student's attendance records, we have an attendance percentage bar (see highlights below) that displays the overall score of a student's attendance that you can view at a quick glance. The attendance percentage is calculated by this formula `(# of present + # of valid) / # of attendance records`

![AttendancePercentage](images/AttendancePercentage.png)

### Adding\Editing a description: `description`

Adds a description to the selected student or Updates an already existing description of the selected student with the given description.

![DescriptionCommand](images/DescriptionCommand.jpg)

Format: `description INDEX desc/DESCRIPTION`

* **Only one description is allowed**. The old description will be replaced with the new description (i.e., when we add/edit a description when one already exists.)
* **Can use special characters**. To accommodate for adding tele handles, percentages/grades, dates etc.

Examples:
*  `description 1 desc/Loves coding`: Adds a description `Loves coding` to first student.
*  `description 2 desc/Absent on 29/04/2023 due to Case Competition`: Adds a description `Absent on 29/04/2023 due to Case Competition` to second student on the list.

### Listing a class to view: `list`

Lists all students in the class.

Format: `list`

### Locating students by name: `find`

Finds students whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `andrew` will match `Andrew`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Nic Faaheem` will match `Faaheem Nic`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `andr` will not match `andrew`
* Students matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Tania Tan` will return `Tania Low`, `Tania Ooi`

Examples:
* `find andrew`: Returns `andrew` and `Andrew`

  ![Find example 1](images/FindCommandCapsInsensitive.png)
* `find nic faaheem` returns `nic`, `faaheem`<br>
  ![result for 'find nic faaheem'](images/FindExample2.png)
* `find John Doe` returns `John Doe`, `Johnathan Doe`, `Johnette Doe`<br>
    ![result for 'find john doe'](images/FindExample3.png)


**Warning**
> If multiple search terms are used, all search terms will be matched with full words as well as incomplete words!

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Clears all entries from the StudentBook in a selected class.
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">
⚠️ Caution: Upon initiating the command to clear all students from the StudentBook, no further prompts will follow.  This action is irreversible and once executed, the data cannot be retrieved.
</div>

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

ClassBook and StudentBook data are saved automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually. You can find the same in the data folder (which is going to be in the same directory as the application (i.e., .JAR file).

### Editing the data file

ClassBook and StudentBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/classbook.json` and `[JAR file location]/data/classbook/[ClassName].json` respectively. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

⚠️ **Caution:** 
- If your changes to the classbook.json data file makes its format invalid (e.g. `"courseCode" : "class_1"` where `class_1` contains non-alphanumeric characters), ClassBook will discard its classes in the classlist and start with an empty data file at the next run. Fortunately, in this case, your StudentBook data (e.g. `class1.json`) will not be lost. It can be recovered by simply recreating the class of that same name in the application (e.g. using the `create` command to `create c/class1`). 
- Furthermore, certain edits to the individual JSON files can cause the application to behave in unexpected ways (e.g. if a value entered is outside the acceptable range, if field names such as `courseCode` are modified, etc.). In the worst case, an invalid modification to the data will cause the program to crash. In this scenario, you are advised to manually delete the modified files before running the program again. 
- As such, do refrain from editing  manually in the JSON file. Edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Coming Soon...
**Clear All**: Instead of manually using the `rm` command to remove each individual class, or the `clear` command to clear the selected StudentBook, this feature will clear all data (including ClassBooks and their respective StudentBooks), increasing convenience for users.

## FAQ

**Q**: Unable to start the program?<br>
**A**: Ensure that Java 11 or above is installed in your operating system. To check if you have Java 11 or above, open the Command Prompt and type in `java -version`. Once verified, navigate to the program's directory and type in `java -jar MustVas.jar` in the Command Prompt. 

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: How can I see the class that I am on right now? <br>
**A**: You can see the class that you have currently selected in the bottom left corner of the application (as shown below). <br>
![selected_class_showing](images/SelectedClassFAQ.png)

**Q**: How can I manually delete students/classes? <br>
**A**: Find your data folder in your home directory where MustVas is stored. In this folder, you will see the `classbook.json` file that contains the list of _courseCode_s, as well as another classbook folder that contains the individual `.json` files of the StudentBook, named after its class name. 
![manually delete class](images/ManuallyDeleteFiles.png)
- You may delete the individual StudentBook by deleting its individual .json file under the classbook folder. Do note that doing so will be akin to using the `clear` command on that class, effectively setting an empty StudentBook to be used.
- However, if you do intend to manually delete an entire class, do remember to delete both its _courseCode_ field in `classbook.json` and its respective `.json` file in the classbook folder. Otherwise, deleting just the _courseCode_ field in the `classbook.json` file would cause the same StudentBook to be used if a class of the same _courseCode_ is created again (i.e. `create c/class5` would reuse its old StudentBook with its old student contacts and not create a new empty StudentBook).

**Q**: How do I fix "This student already exists in the class" error? <br>
**A**: This error is likely due to duplicate fields in `PHONE`, `EMAIL` or `STUDENT_ID`. Check that the new student to be added does not have these duplicate fields that are already present among students in your current class.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **When using view after selecting a class**, if you are viewing your list of classes after having selected a class, the StudentBook of the previously selected class is still considered selected (and will be displayed). Any commands entered to modify this class will take effect until another class is selected from the list of classes.
